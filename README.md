Compare two home loans taking into account capital price,
proportion borrowed, interest rate, salary and income tax level.

By default, the left column (Loan 1) shows a modern loan in the US/UK, while Loan 2 shows the situation in the early 90s, when:
- houses were cheaper
- salaries were lower
- you generally saved 30% as a deposit, borrowing 70% from the bank
- loans were generally for 15 years
- interest rates were nasty
- income tax was higher

Despite most things being cheaper in the 1990s, 
the higher interest rates and shorter-term loans 
made mortgages affordable only for the wealthy 
or for dual-income households. 
On the other hand, if you could afford the 
repayments at 18%, you felt pretty good 5-10 years later when rates declined.

**Capital Cost, Principal, Interest Rate and Term** - the usual loan information

**Monthly Payment** - monthly payments to meet the terms of the loan

**Gross Salary and Income Tax Rate** - your annual salary and your average tax rate. 
Used to calculate how much money you have to pay your mortgage.

**Salary After Tax** - how much you earn each month after tax

**Mortgage Burden** - percentage of your take-home pay required to service the loan.
